Excel
-----
excel files are reffered as WorkBook
each sheet in a excel file is called WorkSheet

in a worksheet we have a grid 
the grid is made of rows and columns

there are 1048576 rows in a single sheet that is numbered
there are 16384 columns in a single sheet that is labelled XFD 
A - Z, AA - Az, BA - BZ.....

cell is an intersection a row and a column
each cell will have an address based on the intersection

col	row	cell address
A	10	    A10
Z	400	    Z400


Exceptions
----------
why do we need exceptions?
 

sys module
Exception

exceptions are in the form of classes
-------------------------------------
Exception is the base class

ZeroDivisionError

ValueError

KeyError

logging module
---------------
levels depending on the error

DEBUG - detailed information typically of interest only when diagnosing problem

INFO - to confirm that things are working as expected

WARNING - Indication that something unexpected happened or indicative of some problem in the near future

ERROR - This tells that due to a more serious problem, the software is not able to perform some function

CRITICAL - This tells serious error, indicating the program itself may be unable to continue executing


NOTSET 		-	0
DEBUG		-	10
INFO		-	20
WARNING		-	30
ERROR		-	40
CRITICAL	-	50


os module  - os.system(dos commands),  os.getcwd(), os.cpu_count

sys module - sys.path, sys.exe_info

Numpy

Numerical Python - Travis Oliphant - 2005

Data Types in Python
By default Python have these data types:

strings - used to represent text data, the text is given under quote marks. e.g. "ABCD"
integer - used to represent integer numbers. e.g. -1, -2, -3
float - used to represent real numbers. e.g. 1.2, 42.42
Boolean - used to represent True or False.
complex - used to represent complex numbers. e.g. 1.0 + 2.0j, 1.5 + 2.5j


Data Types in NumPy
NumPy has some extra data types, and refer to data types with one character, like i for integers, u for unsigned integers etc.


Below is a list of all data types in NumPy and the characters used to represent them.

i - integer
b - boolean
u - unsigned integer
f - float
c - complex float
m - timedelta
M - datetime
O - object
S - string
U - unicode string
V - fixed chunk of memory for other type ( void )


<U6 what is < in the dtype of numpy


 → Little-endian byte order indicator.

- < indicates little-endian byte order, which is relevant for numeric types but generally ignored for strings.

Little-endian is a way of storing multi-byte data in computer memory where the least significant byte (LSB) comes first.

What it means
When a number is stored in memory:
	• Little-endian puts the smallest byte first.
	• Big-endian puts the largest byte first.
